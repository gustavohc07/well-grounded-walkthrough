# Well Grounded Rubyist 3rd Edition Walkthrough

This repository only purpose was for to put down some annotations and some thoughts while I was reading the chapters
Most of it might be completely incorrect or does not make any sense, since I was more focused on learning and some of them I raised before I tried to answer it.

Probably the answer to something I wrote, if you ever read this, is somewhere else. Or even some AHA! moments might come way down the road.

Also, I was changing styles as I moved along, focusing more in code itself than paraphasing what we have in the book.

Otherwise, feel free to dive into some messy notetaking :)

How I rate this book:

4 out of 5 - It lacks exercises. It would be a round 5, but I really do miss exercises by the end of each chapter. There are some, but as you move to other chapters where you were expecting exercises, there will be a total of 0, especially on some subjects like closures (Procs, lambdas), FP style (recursion), Enumerables, Enumerators, Hooks and Callbacks that could use some practice to help get the concepts in your head. Also, I could not find the answer to the few that exist. Although the code worked, it might not been optimal, so having a reference to check is something that should be included in the book.

If it is your first time learning programming, I don't recommend starting with this book. Go get your feet wet with some [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) exercises, or [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and then come back to this book, you will learn the basics to understand a little bit more how some things happens under the hood that are explained in this book.

If you already use Ruby in a daily basis, do not fall in temptation to skip what you know or think you know. In every chapter, even on the beginning ones, I've learned something. You can do some skimming if you want, but my recommendation is that you don't skip it.
