# well-grounded-walkthrough

This repository existance was only for me to put down some annotations and some thoughts.
Most of it might be completely incorrect, since some of them I raised before I tried to answer it.

Probably the answer to something I wrote, if you ever read this, is somewhere else.

Also, I was changing styles as I moved along, focusing more in code itself than paraphasing what
we have in the book.

Otherwise, feel free to dive into some messy notetaking :)


How I rate this book:

4 out of 5 - It lacks exercises. It would be a round 5, but I really do miss exercises by the end of each chapter. There are some, but as you move to other chapters, there will be a total of 0 exercises.

If it is your first time learning programming, I don't recommend starting with this book. Got get your feet wet in some Exercism exercises and then come back to this book, you will learn more and understand a little bit more how some things happens under the hood.
