For some reason I started to think about how we can do:

  regex.match?(string)

    and
  
  string.match(regex)

To just realize that we are sending messages to two different classes, String and Regex.
Both return "MatchData" object.

=end

string = "Peel,Emma,Mrs.,talented amateur"

regex = /[A-Za-z]+,[A-Za-z]+,Mrs?\./ # "?" matches zero or one!

string.match(regex)
# => #<MatchData "Peel,Emma,Mrs.">

regex = /([A-Za-z]+),[A-Za-z]+,(Mrs?\.)/

string.match(regex)
# => #<MatchData "Peel,Emma,Mrs." 1:"Peel" 2:"Mrs.">

puts $1
# => "Peel"

puts "Dear #{$2} #{$1}"


=begin
  TIL: How can we use Regex with parenthesis to creAte a parenthetical groupings.
  This way we can access the matches more easily with global variables ($1).

string = "My phone number is (123) 555-1234."
phone_regex = %r{\((\d{3})\)\s+(\d{3})-(\d{4})}

  ## Notation for represent one or more: "+"
  p /(\d+)/.match("Digits-R-Us 2345")[1]

  ## Specific Numbers of Repetitions

  /\d{3}-\d{4}/
  /\d{1,10}/ # -> This is a range. Between 1 and 10 digits.
  /\d{3,}/ # -> means three or more digits.

  p /([A-Z]{5})/.match("David BLACK")

# Regular expression anchors and assertions

  # - Common anchors: beginning of line "Ë†", end of line "$"

  /^\s*#/


# Modifiers
  /abc/i # -> case insensitive
