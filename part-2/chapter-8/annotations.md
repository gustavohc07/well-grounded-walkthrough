# Chapter 8 - Strings, symbols, and other scalar objects

First question that was raised in my head: what are scalar objects?

It means objects that represents a single value (integers, strings) as opossed to collection or caontiner objects that hold multiple values.

Example: when we have a single temperature measure we have an scalar object, because it represents one and only one data point. If we continue to measure and we have a collection of values, we start to have a non-scalar object - Arrays are non-scalar objects.

## Working with strings

We can manipulate texts with two built-in Ruby classes: Strings and Symbols.

### String encoding

First, what is encoding?

Enconding is when you convert data into a particular form.

For example, Ruby has used UTF-8 instead of US-ASCII as default since version 2.0. New versions of Ruby has added support for non-ASCII characters.
